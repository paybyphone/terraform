# aws\_availability\_zones

Get the Availability Zones available to your account.

## Example Usage
```
resource "aws_availability_zones" "availability_zones" {
	filter {
		name = "region-name"
		values = ["us-east-1"]
	}
	zone_names = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1c"]
}
```

~> **NOTE:** the example above is only shown to illustrate the available
options. During regular operation, it's recommended that you include a very
basic resource declaration, with no options, which will return the availability
zones assigned to your account within the region you are connected to.
